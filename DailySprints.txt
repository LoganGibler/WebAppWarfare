Devs can approve and reject guides      DONE
Users can delete steps on owned guides
Users can upload screenshots to guides
fix page clip when reloading if the guide only has 1 step   
Public posts must be approve and published to show on home  DONE
fix search bar showing unpublished unapproved guides        DONE
Guides with the same title are showing public, when not actually public









Stretch Goals/ future ideas:
  2. Users should have "likes"? Maybe individual likes on guides? All guides
     sorted by likes on home page?
  3. Have Guides not extend forever down the page, have page1, page2, page3.
     Maybe only 5/6 per page. Will have to do research on this.

 4. post questions- either directly related to the guide, or maybe just random forum
    for questions and answers. Should there be approval for this? maybe have input
    sanitization for bad wordsd

 5. rework css into tailwind- its time to use a css framework!
