1. do /publish and /unpublish for frontend
2. Fix the requirment to refresh the page after updating a guide.
    -implement new useeffect for editGuides? research this.
3. its time. time to actually do css. or maybe learn a css framework.
    -Seriously please learn how to actually do css.

4. search bar!

Stretch Goals:
  1. Create new Schema for user questions
      -who made it, when, and users need to be able to comment and answer,
       possibly post more questions like stackoverflow.
            SuperStretch: 
                -maybe have a honor system?
  2. Users should have "likes"? Maybe individual likes on guides? All guides
     sorted by likes on home page?
  3. Have Guides not extend forever down the page, have page1, page2, page3.
     Maybe only 5/6 per page. Will have to do research on this.
