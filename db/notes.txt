search bar!

users need to be able to add screen shots. This needs to be researched.

implement approval for published guides submitted by users to dev

add better alert("failed signing in")


   
will have to review process of token, should place in cookie

hash passwords before they are stored in db, possibly bring PTool for
    hashing algo? might be cool. Will have to review how to deploy flask db.
    maybe run flask db off of laptop? same with mongodb? 


Stretch Goals:
  2. Users should have "likes"? Maybe individual likes on guides? All guides
     sorted by likes on home page?
  3. Have Guides not extend forever down the page, have page1, page2, page3.
     Maybe only 5/6 per page. Will have to do research on this.

     post questions- either directly related to the guide, or maybe just random forum
    for questions and answers. Should there be approval for this? maybe have input
    sanitization for bad words
